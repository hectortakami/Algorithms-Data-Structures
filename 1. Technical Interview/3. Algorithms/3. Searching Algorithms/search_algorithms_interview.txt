# For each of the following questions, decide the searching algorithm that fits
# better for any special case described.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 1: If you know that the solution it's not far from the root node of the tree
# RESPONSE: 
#             BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             BFS starts looking by the closest nodes first
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 2: If the tree is VERY DEEP, and solutions are rare
# RESPONSE: 
#             BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             If the tree it's quite deep, it will take a long time to
#             retreive an answer
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 3: If the tree is VERY WIDE (Not Binary Tree)
# RESPONSE: 
#             DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             If the tree it's quite wide, it will take a long time to 
#             reach each individual level
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 4: If solutions are frequently but located (same leve) 
#            but at the BOTTOM of the tree
# RESPONSE: 
#             DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             Even that are at the same level, if the BOTTOM keyword it's used
#             we will get a better performance using DFS to look for leafs nodes
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 5: Determing wheter a PATH EXISTS OR NOT between 2 nodes
# RESPONSE: 
#             DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             That's the main porpouse of DFS
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROBLEM 6: Finding the SHORTEST PATH between 2 nodes
# RESPONSE: 
#             BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
# EXPLANATION: 
#             That's the main porpouse of BFS
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
