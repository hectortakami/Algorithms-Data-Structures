    1. How does JavaScript works?

        * Program: Memory allocation + Parse and Excecute scripts (run instructions)
        
        * The JS engine (in Chrome Browser) its composed of two things:
            > Memory Heap: Where the variables are stored
            > Call Stack: The First In Last Out (FILO) stack to perform the operations
                > Web API: Where all Async functions get processes (DOM, AJAX, TIMEOUT)
                > Callback Queue (Events as OnClick(), OnLoad())
                > Event Loop

    2. JavaScript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking? 
        * Single threading means that JS only have one Call Stack to allocate operations
        * Non-blockig refers to the fact that having a single Call Stack to deal with, the
          processor never have to deal with deadlocks caused for the competing processes 


    3. Explain the difference between Syncronous and Asyncronous?
        * Syncronous: The instructions in the Call Stack are executed one at the time.
        * Asyncronous: Used for big tasks or API calls, it tells the Call Stack to
                       keep going the execution of the next operations in line, meanwhile
                       the async operation gets done. 

    4. Explain what is a Stack Overflow:
        * Its the scenario when a function gets executed recursevly, flooding the entire
          Call Stack of instructions without any stop condition
