1. A Memory Heap is the same as the 'Heap' data structure?

    * No, the Memory Heap is a region in the memory as in C language 
      or in JavaScript runtime engine where we can store data as 
      declarared variables. Something as 'free space' to programming. 

      The data structure 'Heap' it's a variation of Trees where the data is priorized by levels

      It's just coincidence that both have the same name, but they are not related... 
      in any case the Memory Heap it's more related with the Stacks.

    
2. What's a priority queue and how it's related to Heaps?

    *   The Heap implementation it's sort of a tree but besides in having 2 childrens 
        (one less at the left and one greater at the right) it only knows that it's 
        parent node have a bigger value and all of it's childrens are less in value than 
        the node. 

        In a Priority Queue we can model a data pattern where the nodes closer to the
        root have more priority in order to be dispatched than the branches behind


        EXAMPLE:

                                     Flight Pilot
                                    /             \
                                Passenger      Passenger 

            The pilot have more priority to on-board the airplane than the Passengers,
            but if a Flight Attendant arrives the structure changes, even if she arrived
            before the Passenger...

                                     Flight Pilot
                                    /             \
        Flight Attendant[+]    Attendant       Passenger 
                                   |
                               Passenger


                                     Flight Pilot
                                    /            \
        Another Passenger[+]    Attendant     Passenger 
                                /       \   
                           Passenger  Passenger
